TINGe - Tool Inferring Networks of GEnes (using Mutual Information)


1. Compatibility

This software is implemented using C++ and MPI-2 standards. It has been
tested on the following platforms:

- IBM BlueGene/P (V1R4M2_200_2010-100508P) with IBM XL C++ V9.0
- IBM BlueGene/L (up to V1R3M4_300_2008) with IBM XL C++ V9.0
- SunOS OpenSolaris 5.11 snv_111b on x86, x86_64 with Sun Cluster 8.1
- GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat) on x86, x86_64, IBM QS20,
  IBM QS22, with GCC => 3.4, Intel > 9.x, Sun Studio Express 12 and
  MPICH2, OpenMPI

Any similar platform should work seamlessly.


2. Requirements

To build the software, Jam Make Redux is required. It is available with most
of the modern operating systems. If you are using IBM BlueGene, or if your
OS does not provide "jam", you will have to compile it yourself:
Obtain the Jam source code from here: http://freetype.sourceforge.net/jam/
or from here: http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html, and follow included
documentation for its compilation and installation.


3. Installation

To unpack the tarball, execute the following command:

$ tar xfj TINGe-X.Y.tar.bz2

where X and Y are the major and minor version number. Go to the TINGe-X.Y
directory and select the appropriate architecture:

$ cd TINGe-X.Y/
$ ls -la build/*

The default architecture is mpich. Start the building process for selected
architecture:

$ ./x-build ARCH install

where ARCH is the selected architecture. For example:

$ ./x-build bgp install

will build TINGe for IBM BlueGene/P. If the build process is successful you
should obtain bin directory with tinge-mi executable in it (and several
additional tools). To finalize the installation process, copy the bin and
doc directories to your preferred location, e.g.:

$ su
$ mkdir /opt/tinge
$ cp -r bin /opt/tinge
$ cp -r doc /opt/tinge


4. Running

The way in which you execute the tinge-mi program depends on the type of the
architecture. Please follow instructions included in the tinge.1 man page
for general guidelines.
